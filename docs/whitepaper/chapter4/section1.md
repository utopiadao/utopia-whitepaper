# 4.1 Star Plate Structure and Dimensional Consensus

## Star Plate Structure: Multi-dimensional Regional Division

The regional consensus network adopts a multi-dimensional structure inspired by the cosmic star plate, dividing the value flow space around each participant into three interconnected regions, each with its unique value attributes and resonance characteristics:

• **Zone A (Core Zone)**: The strongest value flow line in the participant's network, providing 30% resonance gain through direct connection

• **Zone B (Halo Zone)**: The second strongest value flow line in the participant's network, providing 10% resonance gain for the entire region

• **Zone C (Star River Zone)**: The sum of all other value flow lines of the participant, providing 15% resonance gain for the entire region

This star plate structure is not static, but continuously adjusts and reorganizes with the dynamic development of the network, ensuring that value always flows toward the most active regions, stimulating continuous value creation.

## Dimensional Consensus: Different Levels of Value Recognition

The regional consensus network provides different degrees of regional consensus permissions according to participants' dimensional choices in the resonance pool:

| Resonance Dimension | Zone A Consensus | Zone B Consensus | Zone C Consensus |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| First Dimension | - | - | - |
| Second Dimension | Direct Connection 30% | - | - |
| Third Dimension | Direct Connection 30% | Entire Region 10% | - |
| Fourth Dimension | Direct Connection 30% | Entire Region 10% | Entire Region 15% |

This progressive permission design encourages participants to gradually improve their participation level as their understanding of the system deepens and their confidence increases. At the same time, it ensures that only participants truly committed to long-term value creation can obtain the maximum network returns.
