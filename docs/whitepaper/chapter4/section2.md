# 4.2 Value Consensus Algorithm and Star Map

## Value Consensus Algorithm

The regional consensus network calculates the value consensus rewards that each participant should receive through a precise mathematical model. The core formula is: User Consensus Reward = ∑(Regional Resonance Returns × Corresponding Regional Consensus Ratio)

This algorithm ensures the following characteristics:

• **Proportionality between value contribution and return**: Greater network contributions bring greater consensus rewards
• **Incentive for diverse participation**: Encourages participants to establish value flows in multiple regions
• **Natural expansion dynamics**: Forms an inherent driving force for continuous network expansion
• **Balanced development guidance**: Guides balanced network development through regional weight design

## Consensus Star Map: Network Visualization

The regional consensus network provides each participant with an intuitive "Consensus Star Map," an advanced data visualization tool that enables participants to clearly see:

• **Value flow paths**: How values flow within the network
• **Regional activity**: Activity levels and performance of various regions
• **Consensus potential**: Value consensus opportunities not fully activated
• **Temporal dynamics**: Network evolution trends over time

The Consensus Star Map is not only an information display tool but also a decision support system that helps participants make wiser network construction decisions.
