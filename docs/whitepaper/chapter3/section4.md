# 3.4 Resonance Process

The process of participating in the resonance pool is simple and transparent:

**Resonance Initialization** - Participants select the resonance dimension and transfer the corresponding value to the respective contract addresses of the resonance pool

**Resonance Confirmation** - The system confirms the value input, records the resonance start time and expected completion time

**Resonance Progress** - Value in the pool generates resonance effects with the values of other participants

**Resonance Completion** - When the resonance cycle ends, the system automatically calculates the resonance results and returns them to the participants' addresses

The entire process is automatically executed by smart contracts, without centralized intervention, ensuring that every participant receives a fair and transparent resonance experience.

The resonance pool is not only the value core of Utopia, but also the embodiment of its philosophical spirit - through intelligently designed collaborative mechanisms, it makes individual value inputs generate collective resonance, creating overall results that exceed the sum of individual actions. This is a completely new paradigm for value creation and sharing, breaking through the limitations of traditional zero-sum games and opening a new era of positive symbiotic wealth.
