# 3.2 Four-Dimensional Resonance Structure

The resonance pool has designed four dimensions of value investment paths, each dimension having its unique resonance characteristics:

| Resonance Dimension | Value Investment (USDT) | Resonance Cycle (Days) | Resonance Amplification Rate (%) | Resonance Return (USDT) |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| First Dimension | 100 | T+1 | 0.5% | 100.5 |
| Second Dimension | 1000 | T+7 | 5% | 1050 |
| Third Dimension | 2000 | T+15 | 13% | 2260 |
| Fourth Dimension | 3000 | T+30 | 30% | 3900 |

Each dimension represents different frequencies and amplitudes of value flow, and participants can choose the most suitable resonance path according to their values and time preferences.
