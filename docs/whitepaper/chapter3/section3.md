# 3.3 Resonance Amplification Principle

The resonance pool does not purely create value, but through precise value flow arrangements, achieves optimal resource allocation and maximization of time value. The core mechanisms of resonance amplification include:

**Time Differential Resonance** - Different resonance cycles of dimensions create time differentials, enabling the resonance pool to utilize the time value of funds

**Network Effect Gains** - The more participants, the stronger the resonance effect, the greater the system's overall value creation capability

**Automatic Balancing Mechanism** - The system intelligently adjusts the fund flow of various dimensions, ensuring overall stability
