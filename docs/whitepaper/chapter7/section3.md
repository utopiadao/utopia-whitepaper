# 7.3 User Interaction and Decentralization

## Ultimate Simplification of User Interaction

### Design Philosophy of Three-Step Participation Process

Utopia simplifies complex blockchain interactions into three steps:

**Step 1: Connect Wallet**  
✓ One-click connection to BSC-supporting Web3 wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)  
✓ Automatic network configuration detection

**Step 2: Select Dimension**  
✓ Intuitive selection of investment amount and cycle  
✓ Real-time calculation and display of expected returns

**Step 3: Confirm Transfer**  
✓ One-click completion of USDT transfer to smart contract  
✓ Automatic setting of correct transfer amount and destination address

### Interaction Simplification Features

- **Single Authorization Mode**: Users only need to authorize USDT on first use, subsequent participation requires no repeated authorization
- **Smart Amount Recognition**: Contract automatically recognizes the dimension corresponding to the transfer amount, without additional parameters
- **Automatic Order Processing**: Due orders are processed through on-chain automation, without manual user operations
- **Transparent Status Query**: All order statuses and system information can be queried in real-time through blockchain explorer

## Complete Decentralization Guarantee

### Non-Upgradeable Design

![Non-Upgradeable Design](/images/图27.svg)

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This contract adopts a non-upgradeable design
 * @dev No upgrade functions, no administrator privileges, no backdoor mechanisms
 */
contract UtopiaCore {
    // All critical parameters are immutable
    IERC20 public immutable token;
    address public immutable continuityRewardAddr;
    address public immutable rewardPoolAddr;
    
    // Pre-computation configuration is set once in constructor, never changes
    Dimension[4] public dimensions;
    
    // No owner variable
    // No upgrade function
    // No pause function
    // No administrator privilege functions
}
```

### Autonomous Operation Mechanism

- **Automated Execution**: All core functions are automatically executed through smart contracts, without human intervention
- **Algorithm-Driven**: Phoenix restart conditions are completely determined by algorithms, without subjective factors
- **Transparent Rules**: All business logic is encoded in smart contracts, publicly verifiable
- **Perpetual Operation**: Once deployed, the system will operate perpetually, cannot be stopped or modified by anyone

## Post-Deployment Immutability

### Immutable Configuration

```solidity
/**
 * @dev All critical configurations are immutable
 */
contract UtopiaCore {
    
    // Token address immutable
    IERC20 public immutable token;
    // System addresses immutable
    address public immutable continuityRewardAddr;
    address public immutable rewardPoolAddr;
    // Dimension configuration is set in constructor then immutable
    Dimension[4] public dimensions;
    constructor(
        address _token,
        address _continuityRewardAddr,
        address _rewardPoolAddr
    ) {
        // One-time setting, never changes
        token = IERC20(_token);
        continuityRewardAddr = _continuityRewardAddr;
        rewardPoolAddr = _rewardPoolAddr;
        // Pre-computation configuration set once
        _initializeDimensions(); // Assumed initialization function
    }
    
    // No functions to modify configuration
    // No owner variable
    // No administrator privileges
    // No upgrade mechanism
    // No pause functionality
}
```
