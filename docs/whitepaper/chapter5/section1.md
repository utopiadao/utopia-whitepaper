# 5.1 The Essence and Selection of Prosperity Nodes

In the universe, stars exist as the core entities of galaxies, not only radiating light and heat themselves, but also influencing surrounding planets and celestial bodies through their gravitational fields, maintaining the balance and order of the entire galactic system. Utopia's prosperity node system is designed precisely based on this universal law, creating a group of energy centers that guide the balanced development and sustainable prosperity of the ecosystem.

## The Essence of Prosperity Nodes

Prosperity nodes are the energy cores and stabilizers in the Utopia ecosystem. Each prosperity node gains system recognition through its own value creation ability and network contribution, becoming a key existence that guides value flow and maintains ecological stability.

Utopia has designed a "prosperity galaxy" composed of 36 prosperity nodes. This number is not a random choice, but is based on ancient mathematical wisdom - 36 is the smallest number less than 100 with 18 divisors, symbolizing high connectivity and resonance potential.

## Proof of Value: The Selection Mechanism for Prosperity Nodes

Unlike traditional blockchain's "Proof of Work" or "Proof of Stake", prosperity nodes are selected based on the "Proof of Value" (PoV) mechanism, which truly measures participants' comprehensive contribution to the ecosystem.

**Selection Criteria:**
1. Calculate each participant's C-zone overall flow line value
2. Rank all participants in descending order by total value
3. Select the top 36 participants as prosperity nodes

This selection mechanism ensures that only those participants who truly promote the ecosystem's value flow and growth can become prosperity nodes, preventing simple capital accumulation from dominating the system.
