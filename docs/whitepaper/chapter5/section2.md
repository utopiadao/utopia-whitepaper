# 5.2 Galactic Sharing and Value Distribution

## Galactic Sharing: Value Distribution Mechanism

Prosperity nodes not only possess honor, but also bear the responsibility of guiding ecosystem development, while enjoying value sharing rights that match their contributions.

**Prosperity Distribution Calculation:**

1. **Node Pool Formation:** 20% of the entire network's revenue flows into the node pool
2. **Node Value Weight:** Node value weight = Node's C-zone total value / Sum of 36 nodes' C-zone total values
3. **Node Prosperity Distribution:** Node prosperity sharing = Node pool × Node value weight

This mechanism ensures the fairness of distribution and dynamic balance. The returns of prosperity nodes are directly related to the network value they create, forming a virtuous cycle.
