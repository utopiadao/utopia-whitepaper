# Preface

Exploring the bottlenecks of cooperation and consensus in human civilization, explaining how blockchain technology solves trust issues, and introducing Utopia as the vision and mission of a consensus-based free wealth network.

Cooperation and consensus are the most important components of human civilization; they are the fundamental differences that distinguish humans from other organisms and enable them to dominate the world. As a highly intelligent and complex group, the lack of trust creates the greatest friction in cooperation, while insufficient transparency is the greatest threat to consensus. With the continuous growth of globalization forces, the bottlenecks in civilizational expansion have become increasingly apparent.

We must acknowledge that centralized societies have made enormous contributions to the rapid development of human civilization over thousands of years. However, the continuously growing global population leads to increased material demand, global resource scarcity, environmental crises, and social conflicts triggered by the widening wealth gap. These factors continuously weaken humanity's overall productivity, directly affecting the next step in human civilization's development. This prompts us to maintain continuous rational reflection on the centralized components of the modern world.

The emergence of blockchain has pointed to a new direction for solving these problems. This consensus system uses technology to generate passive trust, creating immutable consensus mechanisms. The passive trust generated so far is the highest boundary of trust—completely trustless. This technological revolution capable of fundamentally solving the bottlenecks of modern human civilization should receive deep attention from all human society and deserves continuous exploration and experimentation.

Wealth is the basic unit of social cooperation and also the carrier of energy and value. However, in centralized financial systems, our wealth freedom is often restricted, value flow is artificially blocked, and trust costs continue to rise. This situation is neither sustainable nor consistent with the long-term interests of human society.

Utopia is exactly the response to this status quo—a consensus-based free wealth network based on blockchain smart contracts. It is not merely an investment system, but an autonomous evolving value flow ecosystem that redefines the basic rules of wealth creation, distribution, and sharing.

In this new dimension, every participant is both a value creator and a value beneficiary. Through carefully designed core mechanisms such as resonance pools, regional consensus, cluster nodes, and risk restarts, Utopia achieves an unprecedented value circulation model that tightly combines individual aggregation with collective growth.

This is not only a financial revolution but also an ideological revolution. Utopia allows us to rethink the nature of wealth, the potential of cooperation, and the power of consensus. In this transparent world guaranteed by algorithms, trust will no longer be a scarce resource, and cooperation will reach new heights.

"Nothing is eternal, only thoughts endure." Utopia is exactly such an eternal thought—a bold vision about how humans can create and share value more fairly, efficiently, and freely.
