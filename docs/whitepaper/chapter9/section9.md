# 9.9 Misconception Nine: The Team Might Run Away

## Skeptical Viewpoint
"The project team can run away at any time, and investors will lose everything."

## In-depth Clarification

### Decentralized Design Eliminates Exit Scam Risks

**Technical Architecture Guarantees**:

```solidity
contract UtopiaCore {
    // No owner variables
    // No administrative privileges
    // No fund withdrawal functions
    // No system pause functions
    
    // All key parameters are immutable
    IERC20 public immutable token;
}
```

**Contract Characteristics Analysis**:

- Non-upgradeable: Once deployed, never changes
- No backdoors: Code is completely open source, no hidden functions
- Automatic execution: Algorithm-driven, no human intervention
- Fund security: User funds locked in the contract
- Even if the team wanted to run away, they couldn't take the funds

### Comparison with Traditional Exit Scam Projects

**Traditional Exit Scam Project Characteristics**:

- Centralized control: Project team controls all funds
- Fund pool design: Funds concentrated in project team accounts
- Withdrawal permissions: Project team can withdraw funds at any time
- Information opacity: Users cannot verify fund status

**Utopia's Anti-Exit-Scam Design**:

- Decentralized control: No one can control system funds
- Smart contract custody: Funds locked in contracts
- No withdrawal permissions: No one can withdraw others' funds
- Complete transparency: All fund flows queryable on the blockchain

### Open Source Verification Mechanism

**Code Transparency**:

- Source code open: All contract codes are open source
- BSC verification: Verification on blockchain explorer
- Community audit: Accepts review from global developers
- Continuous monitoring: Community continuously monitors contract status
