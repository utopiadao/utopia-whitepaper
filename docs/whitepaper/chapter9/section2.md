# 9.2 Misconception Two: High Return Rates Are Unrealistic

## Skeptical Viewpoint

"A 30% monthly return rate is too high, this is impossible to achieve in reality, there must be a problem."

## In-Depth Clarification

### Economic Explanation of Return Sources

**Network Value Creation Theory**:

- Traditional Investment: Capital → Production → Profit → Return
- Utopia Model: Participation → Network Effect → Value Amplification → Return
- Network Value Formula: V=n×(n-1)×k

Where: n is the number of network nodes, k is the unit connection value

**Network Value Growth**:

- 100-person network: 100×99×k=9,900k
- 1000-person network: 1000×999×k=999,000k
- Growth multiplier: 999,000÷9,900≈101 times

**Time Value Amplification Effect**:

Value flow in the 30-day cycle of the fourth dimension:

- Continuous entry of new participants
- Continuous expansion of network scale
- Exponential growth in value creation capacity
- Network value accumulated over 30 days supports 30% return

### Risk-Adjusted Return Analysis

**Risk-Return Model**:

Expected Return = Risk-free Return + Risk Premium

**Utopia Risk Factors**:

- Technical Risk: Smart contract risks
- Market Risk: Uncertainty in participant behavior
- Liquidity Risk: Possibility of Phoenix restart
- Regulatory Risk: Policy change risks

**Risk-Adjusted Return**: Theoretical return 30% - Risk discount = Actual expected return

### Historical Comparison Verification

**Early Internet Company Return Rates**:

- Amazon (1997-2000): Annual return rate exceeding 1000%
- Google (2004-2007): Annual return rate exceeding 5000%
- Bitcoin (2010-2017): Annual return rate exceeding 20000%

Emerging technologies and models often have ultra-high returns in early stages.

**Historical DeFi Protocol Returns**:

- Compound (2020): Highest annual yield reached 100%+
- Uniswap (2020): Liquidity mining annual yield reached 1000%+
- Pancakeswap (2021): Some pools achieved annual yields of 2000%+

Utopia's 30% monthly return is not abnormal in DeFi history.
