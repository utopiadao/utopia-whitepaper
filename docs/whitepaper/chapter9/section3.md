# 9.3 Misconception Three: The System is Too Complex for Ordinary Users to Understand

## Skeptical Viewpoint
"Blockchain, smart contracts, phoenix restart - these concepts are too complex. How can ordinary people possibly understand them?"

## In-depth Clarification

### Simplicity of User Participation

The system design is complex, but user operation is simple:

User operation flow:

1. Connect wallet
2. Select dimension (100/1000/2000/3000 USDT)
3. Confirm transfer
4. Wait for automatic return upon maturity

The entire process requires only 3 steps, simpler than traditional bank deposits

**Smart contracts automatically handle complex logic**:

What users see: Simple deposit and withdrawal

What the system executes:

- Automatic dimension identification
- Automatic calculation of return amount
- Automatic processing of matured orders
- Automatic distribution of regional consensus rewards
- Automatic management of phoenix restart

Users don't need to understand complex mechanisms; the system handles everything automatically

### Tiered Participation Levels

### User Participation Levels
- **Beginner Users**: Only need to understand "deposit funds, receive upon maturity"
- **Intermediate Users**: Understand differences in returns and cycles across different dimensions
- **Advanced Users**: Understand regional networks and aggregated node mechanisms
- **Professional Users**: Understand the complete economic model and technical architecture
