# 9.8 Misconception Eight: The Economic Model is Unsustainable

## Skeptical Viewpoint
"This model will definitely be unsustainable in the long run and will ultimately collapse."

## In-depth Clarification

### Mathematical Model of Sustainability

**Limitations of Traditional Growth Models**:

- Linear growth model: y=ax+b
- Exponential growth model: y=ae^bx
- Problem: Both assume infinite growth, which is inherently unsustainable

**Utopia Cyclical Model**:

- Cyclical model: y=f(x(modT))
- Where T is the Phoenix restart cycle

**Characteristics of Utopia Cyclical Model**:

- Periodic reset
- Value inheritance
- System purification
- Sustainable operation

### Sustainability of Network Value Creation

**Value Source Analysis**:

Network effect value: V(n)=k×n×(n-1)

When network scale grows:

- Number of connections: n² growth
- Network value: exponential growth
- Value creation: continuous

As long as human society has network needs, network value creation can continue.

### Self-regulation of the Ecosystem

**Natural Balance Mechanism**:

- Participant growth → network value growth → attract more participants
- Too many participants → system pressure increases → trigger Phoenix restart
- Phoenix restart → system purification → new cycle begins

This self-regulation ensures long-term balance.

**Economic Support**:

- Supply-demand balance: Dynamic balance between participation demand and system capacity
- Risk control: Proactive restart to prevent systemic risks
- Value inheritance: Ensuring continuity of core values
- Innovation incentive: Periodic updates to maintain system vitality
