# 9.10 Misconception Ten: Only Early Participants Benefit

## Skeptical Viewpoint

"This model only allows early participants to make money, all latecomers are just bag holders."

## In-Depth Clarification

### Phoenix Restart Eliminates Early Advantages

**Traditional Project Problems**:

- Early advantages: First movers get more tokens/shares
- Late disadvantages: Latecomers can only buy at high prices
- Result: Serious unfairness between early and late participants

**Typical Examples**:

- ICO projects: Early private sale prices extremely low
- Traditional stocks: Early shareholders have low costs
- Real estate: Early buyers have low costs

**Utopia's Fairness Mechanism**:

**Phoenix Restart Effect**:

- Periodic reset eliminates accumulated advantages
- Each cycle is a new beginning
- All participants stand at the same starting line
- Latecomers and early participants enjoy equal opportunities

**Opportunity Equalization**: Nth cycle participants = 1st cycle participants, starting points in new cycles are completely identical.

### Continuous Creation of Network Value

#### Value Creation Model

- **Traditional Model**: Zero-sum game, if someone wins, someone must lose
- **Utopia Model**: Positive-sum game, network value grows continuously

#### Sources of Network Value Growth

- Growth in number of participants
- Growth in network connections
- Network effect amplification
- Collaborative value creation

Each new participant contributes value to the network, rather than diluting existing value.

### Redefinition of Time Value

#### Traditional Time Value Concept

- Early participation = Time advantage = More returns
- Late participation = Time disadvantage = Less returns

#### Utopia's Time Value Concept:
Participation at different times = Different cycle experiences = Equal opportunities
Each cycle has its unique value and opportunities
Time differences do not create unfair advantages
