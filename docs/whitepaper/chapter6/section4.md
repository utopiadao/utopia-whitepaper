# 6.4 Continuous Prosperity Reward Mechanism

## Economic Mechanism of Continuous Prosperity Rewards

After the "Phoenix Restart" mechanism is triggered, the 90% of funds originally planned to enter the "Continuous Node Reward Pool" will be distributed according to the following four-stage plan:

### Core Design Philosophy

#### Progressive Value Release

Abandoning the traditional one-time distribution model, adopting an incremental reward structure that reflects appreciation for continuous participation and long-term commitment, creating new growth momentum curves.

#### Performance-Oriented Fair Distribution

Continuing the original distribution logic of the "Prosperity Pool", ensuring consistency and fairness of internal system rules, allowing true value creators to receive deserved rewards.

### Detailed Distribution Mechanism

#### Reward Recipients:

36 active "Prosperity Nodes" in each distribution stage.

#### Distribution Basis:

Weighted distribution based on the C-zone total performance of each "Prosperity Node". This maintains consistency with the regular selection of "Prosperity Nodes" and the distribution logic of the "Node Pool".

#### Distribution Cycle and Proportions:

Total distribution cycle of 16 weeks, divided into four stages:

### Four-Stage Distribution Plan

#### First Stage (Week 1 to 4 after restart):

* **Distribution Amount**: 10% of the total "Continuous Node Reward Pool"
* **Distribution Method**: Based on the C-zone total performance of each of the 36 prosperity nodes during these 4 weeks, weighted distribution in the 10% prize pool

#### Second Stage (Week 5 to 8 after restart):

* **Distribution Amount**: 20% of the total "Continuous Node Reward Pool"
* **Distribution Method**: Based on the C-zone total performance of each of the 36 prosperity nodes during these 4 weeks, weighted distribution in the 20% prize pool

#### Third Stage (Week 9 to 12 after restart):

* **Distribution Amount**: 30% of the total "Continuous Node Reward Pool"
* **Distribution Method**: Based on the C-zone total performance of each of the 36 prosperity nodes during these 4 weeks, weighted distribution in the 30% prize pool

#### Fourth Stage (Week 13 to 16 after restart):

* **Distribution Amount**: 40% of the total "Continuous Node Reward Pool"
* **Distribution Method**: Based on the C-zone total performance of each of the 36 prosperity nodes during these 4 weeks, weighted distribution in the 40% prize pool

## Mechanism Innovation Value

### Economic Significance

* **Redefining the Restart Concept**: From "starting from zero" to "gradual recovery under value inheritance"
* **Optimizing Incentive Compatibility**: Long-term participants receive greater reward weight, suppressing short-term speculative behavior
* **Achieving Sustainable Development**: The system as a whole evolves toward a healthier ecosystem

### Social Governance Value

* **Establishing Long-term Orientation**: Incentivizing participants to focus on long-term value creation
* **Promoting Ecosystem Stability**: Reducing system volatility through progressive distribution
* **Enhancing Participant Stickiness**: 16-week continuous incentive period improves user retention rate

### Technical Philosophy Breakthrough

* **From Destruction to Construction**: Transforming traditional "creative destruction" into "constructive rebirth"
* **Algorithmic Governance Evolution**: Achieving more intelligent resource allocation through refined parameter design
* **Ecosystem Resilience Enhancement**: The system possesses stronger self-healing and development capabilities after restart
