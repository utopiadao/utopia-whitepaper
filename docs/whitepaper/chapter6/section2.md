## Phase One: Value Identification and Rights Confirmation

The system identifies the last 36 users who created fourth dimension orders that were not yet completed at the time of restart, as the cycle bridging group.

## Phase Two: Precise Execution of Value Distribution

- **10% Bridging Reward**: Distributed equally among the last 36 fourth dimension participants
- **90% Continuous Inheritance**: Enters the continuous node reward pool
