# 11.1 Core Concept Glossary

• **Resonance Pool** - The core value engine of Utopia, a precisely designed value amplifier. Converts participants' value investments into amplified returns. Based on quantum resonance principles, realizing orderly flow and amplification of value.

• **Zone Consensus** - Utopia's network value distribution system, dividing the value space around each participant into three interconnected zones (A-C zones), constructing a multi-dimensional value flow network.

• **Prosperity Node** - 36 top value contributors selected weekly by the system, serving as the energy core and stabilizer of the Utopia ecosystem, guiding value flow and ecological balance.

• **Phoenix Restart** - Utopia's self-renewal mechanism, ensuring the system can achieve nirvana and rebirth when reaching specific conditions, opening new development cycles and realizing perpetual value circulation.

• **Astral Structure** - The organizational form of the zone consensus network, using cosmic celestial body movement as metaphor, describing patterns of value flow and distribution between different zones.

• **Proof of Value (PoV)** - Utopia's mechanism for selecting prosperity nodes, based on participants' comprehensive value contribution to the network rather than simple capital amount or computing power.

• **Resonance Dimension** - Four value investment levels in the resonance pool, each dimension having different resonance cycles and amplification rates, forming diverse value flow pathways.

• **Prosperity Engine** - The core role that prosperity nodes play in the ecosystem, driving value flow and healthy development of the entire system.

• **Galactic Sharing** - The value distribution system among prosperity nodes, allocating prosperity pool resources according to each node's value contribution weight.

• **Network Brain** - The overall design concept of Utopia's smart contract architecture, viewing each functional module as interconnected but functionally independent neurons, collectively forming an organic whole.

• **Value Community** - Utopia's social organizational form, a self-governing collaborative network formed by participants through value creation and sharing, transcending the limitations of traditional organizational forms.
