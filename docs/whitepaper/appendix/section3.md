# 11.3 Terminology Comparison and Acknowledgments

## Appendix D: Terminology Comparison Table

To facilitate readers from different backgrounds in understanding the specialized terminology in the Utopia system, the following comparison table is provided to match Utopia's unique concepts with common terms in traditional finance and blockchain fields:

| Utopia Term | Traditional Field Corresponding Concept | Conceptual Difference |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Resonance Pool | Liquidity Pool/Investment Fund | Resonance Pool emphasizes value amplification and circulation, not simple fund aggregation |
| Regional Consensus | Distribution Network/Referral System | Regional Consensus is based on multi-dimensional value flow, not simple hierarchical structure |
| Prosperity Node | Shareholders/Board of Directors/Validators | Prosperity Node is based on dynamic election through value contribution, not static equity |
| Phoenix Restart | System Reset/Bankruptcy Reorganization | Phoenix Restart is a preset healthy cycle mechanism, not a failure response |
| Resonance Dimension | Investment Term/Risk Level | Resonance Dimension combines time, returns, and permissions, is a multi-dimensional choice |
| Proof of Value | Proof of Stake/Proof of Work | Proof of Value comprehensively evaluates actual contributions, not single resource input |
| Regional Consensus Reward | Sharing Commission/Management Reward | Regional reward is based on overall network health, encouraging balanced development |
| Astral Structure | Organizational Structure/Network Topology | Astral Structure is dynamically self-organizing, not statically designed |
| Continuous Prosperity Reward | Loyalty Reward/Long-term Incentive | Continuous reward evaluates multi-dimensional performance, not just simple duration |
| Network Brain | System Architecture/Business Logic | Network Brain emphasizes organic synergy of parts, not mechanical combination |

## Acknowledgments

The birth of Utopia stems from the collision and fusion of countless sparks of thought, it is the crystallization of collective wisdom.

### Thought Pioneers

First, we pay tribute to those thought pioneers who continuously explored the essence of wealth, social organization, and possibilities of common prosperity throughout human history. From ancient Greek philosopher Plato's ideal republic, to Thomas More's "Utopia", from Adam Smith's "invisible hand", to Eleanor Ostrom's "Governing the Commons", the insights of these forerunners have paved the way for our exploration today.

### Technology Pioneers

The pioneers of blockchain technology provided the foundation for Utopia's technical implementation. Satoshi Nakamoto's pioneering contribution to decentralized consensus, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's exploration of smart contracts, and the improvement of blockchain technology by countless open-source developers have all made systems like Utopia possible.

### Community Participants

Most importantly, thanks to every participant who will participate in the Utopia ecosystem. Your trust, participation, and creativity will transform this concept from idea to reality, from code to a vibrant value network. Every participant is a co-creator of Utopia, every interaction shapes the future of the ecosystem.

Utopia is not the product of a single individual or organization, but an open collaborative platform, an experiment in collective wisdom, a continuously evolving living organism. Thanks to all who believe in this vision and put it into practice, you are the ones who make this dream possible.
